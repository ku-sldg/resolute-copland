@inproceedings{Chen:2006:Protocol-Property-Based-Attestation,
	abstract = {The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has issued several specifications to enhance the architecture of common computing platforms by means of new functionalities, amongst others the (binary) attestation to verify the integrity of a (remote) computing platform/application. However, as pointed out recently, the binary attestation has some shortcomings, in particular when used for applications: First, it reveals information about the configuration of a platform (hardware and software) or application. This can be misused to discriminate certain configurations (e.g., operating systems) and the corresponding vendors, or be exploited to mount attacks. Second, it requires the verifier to know all possible ``trusted'' configurations of all platforms as well as managing updates and patches that change the configuration. Third, it does not necessarily imply that the platform complies with desired (security) properties. A recent proposal to overcome these problems is to transform the binary attestation into property-based attestation, which requires to only attest whether a platform or an application fulfills the desired (security) requirements without revealing the specific software or/and hardware configuration.Based on previous works, we propose a concrete efficient property-based attestation protocol within an abstract model for the main functionalities provided by TCG-compliant platforms. We prove the security of this protocol under the strong RSA assumption and the discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model. Our scheme allows blind verification and revocation of mappings between properties and configurations.},

@inproceedings{Ott:2023:Universal-Remote-Attestation-Cloud-Platforms,
	abstract = {With more computing workloads being shifted to the cloud, verifying the integrity of remote software stacks through remote attestation becomes an increasingly important topic. During remote attestation, a prover provides attestation evidence to a verifier, backed by a hardware trust anchor. While generating this information, which is essentially a list of hashes, is easy, examining the trustworthiness of the overall platform based on the provided list of hashes without context is difficult. Furthermore, as different trust anchors use different formats, interaction between devices using different attestation technologies is a complex problem. To address this problem, we propose a universal, hardware-agnostic device-identity and attestation framework. Our framework focuses on easing attestation by having provers present meaningful metadata to verify the integrity of the attestation evidence. We implemented and evaluated the framework for Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), AMD SEV-SNP attestation, and ARM PSA Entity Attestation Tokens (EATs).},

We propose to measure the target program and all the objects it depends on, with an assumption that the Secure Kernel and the Trusted Platform Module provide a secure execution environment through process separation. The attestation of the target program begins with a program analysis on the source code or the binary code in order to find out the relevant executables and data objects. Whenever such a data object is accessed or a relevant executable is invoked due to the execution of the target program, its state is measured for attestation.

@inproceedings{Usman:2023:Attestation-Assurance-Arguments,
	abstract = {Remote attestation (RA) is emerging as an important security mechanism for cyber-physical systems with strict security requirements. Trusted computing at large and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in particular have been identified as key technologies to enable RA since they ideally allow retaining some element of control over remote devices despite them being compromised at the OS level. Unfortunately, sometimes it is claimed that TEEs provide RA support without really substantiating how this support is provided. In this paper we build the assurance arguments for RA to carefully map how secure RA depends on underlying security properties and how these in turn can be provided by TEE capabilities. We base our security analysis of RA on existing literature on security requirements for RA and use Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) as the method to build the security arguments. Our analysis identifies the set of TEE properties (as described in the GlobalPlatform standard) that are needed to support RA, and which goals that cannot be mapped to TEE implementations, and therefore require other forms of evidence for RA to be trusted at the top level.},

@inproceedings{Ammar:2021:Delegated-Attestation,
	abstract = {Remote Attestation (RA) is an interaction between a trusted verifier (Vrf) and one or more remote and potentially compromised devices (provers or Prv-s) that allow the former to measure the software state of the latter. RA is particularly relevant to safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS) where a set of low-end micro-controllers (MCUs), operate under the control of a remote and more powerful controller. In such cases, RA is an effective and relatively efficient means to detect software compromise, e.g., malware infections, on these low-end MCUs that cannot support expensive security mechanisms.Unfortunately, current RA techniques have a major practical limitation by requiring one or more of: (i) customized hardware support on every Prv; or (ii) physical presence of Vrf, which must be directly connected to all Prv-s, or (iii) secure pre-loading of trusted software. To overcome this limitation, we construct, implement and evaluate a Delegated Attestation (DA) scheme. In it, all Prv-s remain unmodified, meaning that it applies even to already deployed CPS devices. However, there is no requirement for Vrf's physical proximity, hardware support or secure initial software pre-loading. Instead, DA uses a recently proposed primitive (called Proofs-of-Execution or PoX) which entails a single customized low-end embedded device (called Attestation Proxy or Prox) on the same local-area network (e.g., a CAN-bus) as Prv-s. In doing so, DA enables RA of all Prv-s. Importantly, this guarantee holds even if Prox is itself compromised, enabling secure RA of completely unmodified Prv-s in an efficient manner.},

@article{Mondal:2023:PReFeR-Attestation-Protocol,
	abstract = {Remote attestation is a request-response based security service that permits a trusted entity&nbsp;(verifier) to check the current state of an untrusted remote device&nbsp;(prover). The verifier initiates the attestation process by sending an attestation challenge to the prover; the prover responds with its current state, which establishes its trustworthiness. Physically Unclonable Function&nbsp;(PUF) offers an attractive choice for hybrid attestation schemes owing to its low overhead security guarantees. However, this comes with the limitation of secure storage of the PUF model or large challenge-response database on the verifier end. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a hybrid attestation framework, named PReFeR, that leverages a new class of hardware primitive known as Physically Related Function&nbsp;(PReF) to remotely attest low-end devices without the requirement of secure storage or heavy cryptographic operations. It comprises a static attestation scheme that validates the memory state of the remote device prior to code execution, followed by a dynamic run-time attestation scheme that asserts the correct code execution by evaluating the content of special registers present in embedded systems, known as hardware performance counters&nbsp;(HPC). The use of HPCs in the dynamic attestation scheme mitigates the popular class of attack known as the time-of-check-time-of-use&nbsp;(TOCTOU) attack, which has broken several state-of-the-art hybrid attestation schemes. We demonstrate our protocol and present our experimental results using a prototype implementation on Digilent Cora Z7 board, a low-cost embedded platform, specially designed for IoT applications.},

@inproceedings{Javaid:2020:Defining-Trust-IoT-Blockchain-Attestation,
	abstract = {The constantly growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their resource-constrained nature makes them particularly vulnerable and increasingly attractive for exploitation by cyber criminals. Current estimates commonly reach the tens of billions for the number of connected 'things'. The heterogeneous capabilities of these devices serve as a motivation for resource sharing among them. However, for effective resource sharing, it is essential that trust be retained in the multitude of pervasive and diverse IoT devices. Remote attestation is a well-known technique used to build such trust. Thus, this paper proposes a blockchain based remote attestation protocol to establish trust between IoT devices. The blockchain offers a secure framework for device registration while the attestation is based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF). This combination of technologies results in a tamper resistant scheme with protection against physical and proxy attacks.},

@inproceedings{Alam:2008:Model-Based-Behavioral-Attestation,
	abstract = {Remote attestation is an important characteristic of trusted computing technology which provides reliable evidence that a trusted environment actually exists. Existing approaches for the realization of remote attestation measure the trustworthiness of a target platform from its binaries, configurations, properties or security policies. All these approaches are low-level attestation techniques only, and none of them define what a trusted behavior actually is and how to specify it. In this paper, we present a novel approach where the trustworthiness of a platform is associated with the behavior of a policy model. In our approach, the behavior of a policy model is attested rather than a software or hardware platform. Thus, the attestation feature is not tied to a specific software or hardware platform, or to a particular remote attestation technique, or to an individual type of security policy. We select usage control (UCON) as our target policy model as it is a comprehensive and exible model. We propose a framework to identify, specify, and attest different behaviors of UCON.},

@inproceedings{Nunes:2021:TOCTOU-Remote-Attestation,
	abstract = {Much attention has been devoted to verifying software integrity of remote embedded (IoT) devices. Many techniques, with different assumptions and security guarantees, have been proposed under the common umbrella of so-called Remote Attestation (RA). Aside from executable's integrity verification, RA serves as a foundation for many security services, such as proofs of memory erasure, system reset, software update, and verification of runtime properties. Prior RA techniques verify the remote device's binary at the time when RA functionality is executed, thus providing no information about the device's binary before current RA execution or between consecutive RA executions. This implies that presence of transient malware (in the form of modified binary) may be undetected. In other words, if transient malware infects a device (by modifying its binary), performs its nefarious tasks, and erases itself before the next attestation, its temporary presence will not be detected. This important problem, called Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use ( TOCTOU ), is well-known in the research literature and remains unaddressed in the context of hybrid RA.In this work, we propose Remote Attestation with TOCTOU Avoidance (RATA): a provably secure approach to address the RA TOCTOU problem. With RATA, even malware that erases itself before execution of the next RA, can not hide its ephemeral presence. RATA targets hybrid RA architectures, which are aimed at low-end embedded devices. We present two alternative techniques - RATA A and RATA B - suitable for devices with and without real-time clocks, respectively. Each is shown to be secure and accompanied by a publicly available and formally verified implementation. Our evaluation demonstrates low hardware overhead of both techniques. Compared with current hybrid RA architectures - that offer no TOCTOU protection - RATA incurs no extra runtime overhead. In fact, it substantially reduces the time complexity of RA computations: from linear to constant time.},

@inproceedings{Armknecht:2013:Software-Attestation-Framework,
	abstract = {Software attestation has become a popular and challenging research topic at many established security conferences with an expected strong impact in practice. It aims at verifying the software integrity of (typically) resource-constrained embedded devices. However, for practical reasons, software attestation cannot rely on stored cryptographic secrets or dedicated trusted hardware. Instead, it exploits side-channel information, such as the time that the underlying device needs for a specific computation. As traditional cryptographic solutions and arguments are not applicable, novel approaches for the design and analysis are necessary. This is certainly one of the main reasons why the security goals, properties and underlying assumptions of existing software attestation schemes have been only vaguely discussed so far, limiting the confidence in their security claims. Thus, putting software attestation on a solid ground and having a founded approach for designing secure software attestation schemes is still an important open problem.We provide the first steps towards closing this gap. Our first contribution is a security framework that formally captures security goals, attacker models and various system and design parameters. Moreover, we present a generic software attestation scheme that covers most existing schemes in the literature. Finally, we analyze its security within our framework, yielding sufficient conditions for provably secure software attestation schemes. We expect that such a consolidating work allows for a meaningful security analysis of existing schemes, supports the design of secure software attestation schemes and will inspire new research in this area.},

Traditionally, plain binary attestation (i.e., attesting the integrity of software by measuring their binaries) is the method of choice. Especially in the resource-constrained embedded domain with the ever-growing number of integrated services per platform, this approach is not feasible since the challenger has to know all possible 'good' configurations of the prover. In this work, a new approach based on software privileges is presented. It reduces the number of possible configurations the challenger has to know by ignoring all services on the prover that are not used by the challenger. For the ignored services, the challenger ensures that they do not have the privileges to manipulate the used services. To achieve this, the prover measures the privileges of its software modules by parsing their binaries for particular system API calls. The results show significant reduction of need-to-know configurations. The implementation of the central system parts show its practicability, especially if combined with a fine-grained system API.},

@inproceedings{Bampatsikos:2019:BARRETT,
	abstract = {Today, an increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare devices, crucial to a person's wellbeing and life, connects to the internet and consequently is exposed to a variety of threats. These devices possess low computational resources, and as a result they cannot use security tools such as antivirus or firewalls. Consequently, they become easy targets for cyber-attacks and malware infection, thus putting a person's life at risk. One way to protect these devices from malware infection is Remote Attestation (RA), a process by which a device with low computational power (prover) verifies its internal state to a party with higher computational resources (verifier) upon the latter's request. However, in case the verifier is malicious, it may constantly send numerous requests for RA to a prover to prevent it from performing the functions it was designed for. Thus, keeping it busy and rendering it unusable to its legit users as well as services. In short, the verifier performs a Computational Denial of Service (CDoS) attack against the prover. This paper proposes the BARRETT architecture which uses a Public Ethereum Network (PEN) in conjunction with an RA protocol to protect the prover from CDoS attacks. In particular, the PEN in BARRETT deters CDoS by forcing the verifier to pay a fee in Ether cryptocurrency every time they wish to send an Attestation Request (AR) to a prover. The verifier pays the fee since in BARRETT it can send the AR only via Ethereum transactions. Consequently, any attempt to perform a CDoS becomes prohibitively expensive.},

	abstract = {Given the limited resources and computational power of current embedded sensor devices, memory protection is difficult to achieve and generally unavailable. Hence, the software run-time buffer overflow that is used by the worm attacks in the Internet could be easily exploited to inject malicious codes into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Previous software-based remote code verification approaches such as SWATT and SCUBA have been shown difficult to deploy in recent work. In this paper, we propose and implement a remote attestation protocol for detecting unauthorized tampering in the application codes running on sensor nodes with the assistance of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), the tiny, cost-effective and tamper-proof cryptographic microcontrollers. In our design, each sensor node is equipped with a TPM and the firmware running on the node could be verified by the other sensor nodes in a WSN, including the sink. Specifically, we present a hardware-based remote attestation protocol, discuss the potential attacks an adversary could launch against the protocol, and provide comprehensive system performance results of the protocol in a multi-hop sensor network testbed.},

	abstract = {Resolute is a tool and language for embedding an assurance argument in a system architecture model and evaluating the validity of the associated evidence. In this paper we report on a number of extensions to Resolute that support systems engineers in developing safe and cyber-resilient systems. System requirements are imported as assurance goals to be satisfied. Architectural transforms are applied to the system model to address these requirements, while corresponding assurance strategies and evidence are automatically added to document how the requirements have been satisfied. Subsequent changes to the model that invalidate any of the assurance claims can be detected and corrected. We also use Resolute to check that the model satisfies rules for code generation and other modeling guidelines. We conclude with an application of the Resolute assurance process to the design of a mission planning system for an unmanned air vehicle.},

natural language. This
paper contains a brief summary, more descriptive than technical, of
our research in specifying
a complete and accurate formal semantics for ANSI C. We follow the
denotational
approach and divide the specification in three distinct phases:
static, typing and dynamic
semantics. Moreover, we have developed a direct implementation of the
semantics, using
the programming language Haskell. We argue that our formal
specification results in a better
understanding of the semantics of ANSI C and comment on its
readability, precision,

  structures. It focuses on the problem where a programmer wants to
  operate only on a small subset of the datatype, leaving a large

  first class object and uses the record syntax to replace specific
  elements of the algebra. This leads to definition of some algebra
  combinators. The authors spend a fair amount of time analyzing ways
  to combine monadic algebras. 

This work operates on a recursively
  defined datatype, not using the functorized version as found in
  Duponcheel and Gayo's work.}},
